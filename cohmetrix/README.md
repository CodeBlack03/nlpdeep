Coh-Metrix-Port 2.0
===================

Coh-Metrix-Port is an adaptation of the Coh-Metrix text analysis tool to the Brazilian Portuguese language. Coh-Metrix (http://cohmetrix.memphis.edu/cohmetrixpr/index.html), originally developed at the University of Memphis, is a Web-based tool that calculates textual metrics intended to evaluate cohesion, coherence and readability of texts. It replaces and extends traditional, surface-level readability formulas by using a variety of NLP tools and resources to more accurately evaluate text coherence.

Coh-Metrix-Port had already been implemented in Ruby, and used in several research scenarios. For more details, see Scarton & Aluísio [2010] and Scarton et al. [2010]. This version is called Coh-Metrix-Port 1.0, and its code has not been released public.

The 2.0 version is a complete, from-scratch rewrite of Coh-Metrix-Port 1.0 in Python. It uses updated resources and tools for improved performance, and includes metrics previously unavailable in Coh-Metrix-Port 1.0.
